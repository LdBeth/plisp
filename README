Though PDF has made obsolete PostScript sometimes I still find it useful.

A few minor attempts are made to fix old-fashioned constructs.

HOW TO USE?
ASDF load it and the only API is PLISP:PS. A introduction to
Plisp is resident in doc/.

TODOs:

Enable interactive programming.

Pretty printing generated PS file.
